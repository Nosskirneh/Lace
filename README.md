# Lace
Compatible with iOS 10.

Lace allows you to control Notification Center and Control Center with ease. It comes with the following features:

### Notification Center

Not a fan of the new search in iOS 10 and thinking it just takes up space? Hide it and be done with it.

You can choose to display the Notification view if and only if any notifications are present, and otherwise go directly to the Today view.

Choose to always show the Today view or the Notification view.

Override the default behavior of the chevron icon by having it show the one pointing upwards, downwards or being a straight line.
